There are currently about 80 essential indicators in the regional data warehouse. They cover many areas such as demographics, disease burden, health service utilization, health financing, human resources and epidemic diseases. At the moment it is the epidemiological indicators that are being reported by countries, but the plan is to expand with the rest in 2016."
